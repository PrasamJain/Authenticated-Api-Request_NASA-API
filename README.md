### APOD
One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications.


With the help of NASA's Api we fetch the images of different-different planets like mars and append on our web page's background. Every day, images will be changed and our web sites looks amazing.

We sets various properties like - date, start_date, end_date, count, thumbs, api_key etc.
